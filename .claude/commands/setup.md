Set up a new project following Thomas's guidelines:

1. Initialize appropriate project structure for the specified technology
2. Set up testing framework (Vitest for JS/TS, pytest for Python, built-in for Go)
3. Configure linting and formatting tools
4. Create GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
5. Set up proper .gitignore
6. Create initial README with required sections
7. Configure pre-commit hooks
8. Add basic monitoring/observability setup

Ask what type of project this is, then proceed with the setup.
