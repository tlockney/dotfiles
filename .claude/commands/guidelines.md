Please read and follow all guidelines in my CLAUDE.md file. Pay special attention to the CRITICAL RULES section:

1. **TypeScript Types**: NEVER use `any` type. Use `unknown` for truly unknown types, then narrow with type guards.
2. **Commit Messages**: NEVER mention Claude, AI, or automated assistance in commit messages.  
3. **Code Preservation**: NEVER rewrite existing implementations without explicit permission.

Before making any changes, refer to the full guidelines document. If you're unsure about any rule or practice, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

Confirm that you've loaded the guidelines and are ready to follow them throughout our session.
