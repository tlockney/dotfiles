Reminder of Thomas's 3 CRITICAL RULES that must NEVER be broken:

1. **NEVER use `any` type in TypeScript** - use `unknown` and type guards instead
2. **NEVER mention Claude/AI in commit messages** - use conventional format only
3. **NEVER rewrite existing code without explicit permission** - modify incrementally

Are you following all of these rules in our current work? If any violations exist, please identify and fix them immediately.
